# Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Industry

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using a dataset from a telecom company. The aim is to identify customers who are likely to churn and to understand the key factors influencing their decision.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry, where competition is high and retaining customers is crucial for profitability. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, companies can take proactive measures to retain them.

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical data. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts churn and provides insights into the key factors driving it.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers from a telecom company. It includes various features such as:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Total charges
- Services subscribed (Internet, Phone, etc.)
- Payment method
- Churn (target variable)

You can download the dataset from [here](link-to-dataset) or use your own dataset with a similar structure.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-churn-prediction



## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that might be useful for prediction.
3. **Model Selection**: Trying different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the best one.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model parameters to improve performance.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

You can find the evaluation results in the `evaluation_results.txt` file.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The key features influencing churn are:

- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Payment method

For more detailed results, refer to the evaluation section in the `Model_Training.ipynb` notebook.
